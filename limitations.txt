Limitations:

1. The user must specify their desired scope with each expression.
This language cannot determine the scope intelligently. The user must specify which scope they want to operate on with each expression. This creates room for errors and creates extra code.
2. When using Variable(), the user must wrap their variable name in a Value() case.
Instead of being able to type Variable("variableName"), the user must type Variable(Value("variableName")). This is because Variable is expecting a SetExp as its input and not a string.
This adds extra code.
3. Assign() can only insert one object at a time.
The user must invoke Assign multiple times if they want to insert many objects at once. This becomes fatiguing if there are many objects to insert.
